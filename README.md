# Technical Documentation for CryptoSwap Component

## Setup and Running the Project

To set up and run the CryptoSwap project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **npm**: Version 5.6 or higher (comes with Node.js)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-swap.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the development server with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**:
   Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application files.
- **`components/`**: Contains reusable components like `CryptoSwap`, `OrderRouting`, `PriceChart`, and `TokenModal`.
- **`redux/`**: Contains the Redux store configuration and slices.
- **`public/`**: Contains static assets like images and icons.

## Architecture Decisions

The `CryptoSwap` component is designed as a functional React component utilizing hooks for state management. The architecture follows a component-based design, promoting reusability and separation of concerns. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Functional Components**: The use of functional components allows for a more concise and readable codebase, leveraging React hooks for state and lifecycle management.
- **Modular Design**: The component imports several sub-components (`OrderRouting`, `PriceChart`, and `TokenModal`), which encapsulate specific functionalities, enhancing maintainability and testability.
- **TypeScript**: The use of TypeScript provides type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience through better tooling and autocompletion.

## State Management Approach

State management in the `CryptoSwap` component is handled using the `useState` hook from React. The component maintains a single state object that encapsulates all relevant data, including:

- `sellAmount`: The amount of cryptocurrency the user intends to sell.
- `buyAmount`: The amount of cryptocurrency the user intends to buy.
- `usdValue`: The USD equivalent of the sell amount.
- `receiveUsdValue`: The USD equivalent of the buy amount.
- `isModalOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the token selection modal is open.
- `buySelectedToken` and `sellSelectedToken`: Objects representing the selected tokens for buying and selling.
- `buyTriggered`: A boolean indicating if the buy token was triggered.

This approach allows for a centralized state management strategy, making it easier to manage and update the state based on user interactions.

## Performance Considerations

Several performance considerations have been taken into account:

- **State Updates**: The component uses functional updates to the state, which ensures that the latest state is used when calculating new values. This prevents potential issues with stale state.
- **Memoization**: While not explicitly implemented in the current code, using `React.memo` or `useMemo` for expensive calculations or components that do not need to re-render on every state change can improve performance.
- **Event Handlers**: The event handlers are defined inline, which is acceptable for this component's size. However, for larger components, it may be beneficial to define them outside the render method to prevent unnecessary re-creations on each render.

## Known Limitations

Despite the robust design, there are some known limitations:

- **Token Data Management**: The `tokenValues` object is hardcoded, which limits flexibility. Ideally, this data should be fetched from an API to ensure it is up-to-date with current market values.
- **Gas Fees Calculation**: The gas fees are currently hardcoded, which may not reflect real-time transaction costs. Integrating a dynamic gas fee calculation based on network conditions would enhance the user experience.

By addressing these limitations and considering the outlined architecture and performance strategies, the `CryptoSwap` component can be further enhanced to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience.
